                Terms & conditions of using payment gateway
              </h4>
              <p style="color: #999999; font-size: 13px">
                If you are using the payment gateway to pay online using
                Debit/Credit Card or Net banking, then you are doing so with the
                consultation/approval of the card owner/account holder (if in
                case you are not the card holder/account holder yourself). If
                the payment is not processed because of any reasons, then you
                are supposed to deposit make the payment to our Bank Account
                within next 24 hours, otherwise the respective case/s will be
                cancelled. Due to loss of availability or technical error there
                could be a possibility that the booking might not go through
                while processing the payment through Credit/Debit card or Net
                banking account. During such circumstances our support team
                shall refund the full amount (the actual amount the said booking
                is processed for without deducting the applicable charges)
                within 24 working hours of the booking processed to the same
                Credit/Debit Card or Net banking account from which the booking
                is processed. If transaction is found suspicious by our risk
                management team and to protect your payment from potential
                fraud, we are forced to identify the credit card holder before
                we proceed with the payment. You may be asked to submit
                identification proof along with front copy of your credit card
                by email to complete your transaction. If you failed to produce
                the said documents on time, then your transaction/Reservation
                will be cancelled with immediate effect Transaction processing
                charge will be borne by the user for using the payment Gateway.
                If the transaction has been cancelled by the user, processing
                charges will still apply to the Agent/card holder as per the
                cancellation policy mentioned below As a standard process if the
                payment is not processed because of some technical error or
                cancelled by the user, then the refund will be initiated in same
                Credit card / Debit card or Net banking account through which
                the booking has been originally processed. (Refund handling
                charges will be applicable in case of cancellation of booking
                from agents end over and above the cancellation charges as
                specified in the booking) Payment Gateway is an additional
                Payment option available for the user and is not the only option
                for making Payments. You can contact us to make your payment by
                transferring funds to our bank account directly.
